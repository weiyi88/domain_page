## Project Description

This is a static website designed to showcase the MCP domain (chinamcp.ai) and its relevance to the AI technology ecosystem. The website automatically detects the user's browser language and displays content in either Chinese or English, providing information about MCP, the domain's value, and contact information for potential buyers.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Content**: Includes a real-time date and time display in the header.
- **Stylish UI**: Uses a modern, cyber-themed color scheme with neon effects and animations.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including custom animations and responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript**: For language detection, dynamic content updates, and interactive elements.
